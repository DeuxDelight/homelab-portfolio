# homelab-portfolio

This repository documents hands-on labs and projects I am building to strengthen my system administration and IT infrastructure skills.

The goal of this portfolio is to show **how I think, troubleshoot, and verify systems**, not just that I followed tutorials.

## Why This Repo Exists

This repository is intentionally **documentation-focused**.

Each lab includes:
- What I was trying to accomplish
- What broke
- Why it broke
- How I fixed it
- How I verified success

This mirrors real-world troubleshooting and change management, not theoretical exercises.
